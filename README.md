Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository!

This is a clean, responsive, and modern personal portfolio website template designed for a backend developer. It focuses on simplicity and a professional dark aesthetic, providing a foundation for you to build upon.

About This Project
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a developer, showcasing my skills, projects, and a direct way for you to connect with me. The site is a single-page application (SPA) built with a lightweight stack of HTML and Tailwind CSS, making it fast, elegant, and easy to maintain.

It is designed to be a static front end that can be easily integrated with a Django or any other backend framework for dynamic content or a contact form.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Dark Theme: A professional dark color scheme with vibrant accent colors.

Project Showcase: A dedicated section to highlight key projects with descriptions, technologies, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.

Skills Section: An organized view of my technical skills, categorized for clarity.

Contact Links: Easy access to my professional social media profiles and email.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Typography: Inter Font

Icons: Inline SVG for a lightweight and scalable solution

Getting Started
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to view this file.

Installation
Download or copy the portfolio.html file.

Open the portfolio.html file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Customization
This template is a canvas for your personal brand. Here is a checklist to make it your own:

Open portfolio.html in a code editor.

Tell your story: Replace the placeholder text in the "About" section with a compelling narrative about your passion and professional journey.

Show your work: Fill in the "Projects" section with your most impactful work. Include a short description and links to the live project and source code.

List your skills: Customize the "Skills" section to reflect your expertise.

Personalize your links: Update the mailto:your.email@example.com, LinkedIn, and GitHub links with your own information.

Backend Integration (Optional)
This template is designed to be a static front end, but it can be seamlessly integrated with a dynamic backend, such as a Django project, to manage your data (e.g., projects, blog posts, or a contact form).

Here's a high-level overview of how to do that:

Place the HTML in a template directory: In your Django project, move the portfolio.html file into a templates directory within your app.

Define a URL and a View: Create a Django view to render the HTML file, and configure a URL pattern to serve it. This will allow Django to handle the requests for your portfolio page.

Create RESTful APIs: To make the projects, skills, or other sections dynamic, use a library like Django REST Framework (DRF). You can create API endpoints that return your data as JSON, and then use simple JavaScript fetch calls in your portfolio.html file to retrieve and display this data dynamically.

Hosting
This is a static website, which means it can be hosted for free on various platforms without requiring a server. Recommended options include:

GitHub Pages: Host directly from a public GitHub repository.

Netlify: Connect your GitHub repository for automated, lightning-fast deployments.

Vercel: Another excellent choice for seamless Git integration and hosting.
