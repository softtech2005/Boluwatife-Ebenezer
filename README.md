Boluwatife Seth Ebenezer – Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to Boluwatife Seth Ebenezer’s personal portfolio website repository.

This project is a clean, responsive, and modern personal portfolio website template designed specifically for a backend developer. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and a professional dark-themed aesthetic, providing a solid foundation that can be easily extended or customized.

About This Project

This portfolio represents my journey as a developer. It showcases my technical skills, selected projects, and provides a direct way for visitors to connect with me professionally.

The website is built as a single-page application (SPA) using a lightweight frontend stack—HTML and Tailwind CSS—making it fast, elegant, and easy to maintain.

It is intentionally designed as a static frontend, allowing seamless integration with Django or any other backend framework for dynamic content, APIs, or a contact form.
